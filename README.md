This program uses the People Detection Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/people-detection/data)
For demonstration purposes, this repository includes a small sample of 10 rows from the original Kaggle dataset (Same_Person_Detection.csv)

Due to licensing issues, I will not be including the entire dataset file. 

Using the dataset to run program:
1. Use the link above to download the dataset
2. Locate one of the three CSV Files. (I used the CSV file _annotations located in the 'test' folder)
3. Copy or move the CSV file into your project's folder along with PersonDetection.h, PersonDetection.cpp and main.cpp
(You may have to place a copy of the .CSV in your Debug Folder)
4. Build Solution
5. Run Solution

If you decide to rename any of the CSV files you're using, be sure to include those changes in the code or it won't work.

Using the sample file to run program:
1. Download all the files included
2. Place all the files in your project
(You may have to place a copy of the .CSV in your Debug Folder)
4. Build Solution
5. Run Solution
