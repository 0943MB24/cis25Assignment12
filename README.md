This program uses the People Detection Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/people-detection/data)

Due to licensing issues, I will not be including the dataset file. To run this program: 
1. Use the link above to download the dataset
2. Locate one of the three CSV Files. I used the CSV file _annotations located in the 'test' folder.
3. Copy or move the CSV file into your project's folder along with PeopleDetection.h, PeopleDetection.cpp and main.cpp to use it. You may have to place a copy of the CSV in your Debug Folder.
4. Build solution, then run

If you decide to rename any of the CSV files you're using, be sure to include those changes in the code or it won't work.
